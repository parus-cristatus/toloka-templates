### For Fun. html/css/js task interface snippets. Never heard of Handlebars, looks intriguing 🚐


### Docs:

* [Task interface](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/spec/)
* [List of built-in Handlebars components](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/t-components/)
* [Classes to manipulate and extend](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/spec-advanced/)

### Side notes:
Used ChatGPT for some simple logic. Structure, patterns, combinatorics / analysis, concise and more difficult logic are still up to human brain.. Mainly Few-Shot Prompting was enough
