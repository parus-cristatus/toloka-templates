### html/css/js task interface snippets created with the help of ChatGPT. Mainly Few-Shot Prompting was enough


### Docs:

* [Task interface](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/spec/)
* [List of built-in Handlebars components](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/t-components/)
* [Classes to manipulate and extend](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/spec-advanced/)

### Side notes:
Used ChatGPT for some simple logic or separate pure functions. Structure, patterns, combinatorics / analysis, concise and more difficult logic are still up to human brain..
